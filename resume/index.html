My idea was to begin by training amateur athletes and then representing them in their professional careers. Unfortunately, I wasn't enamored with the legal side of things and also decided it was much more rewarding to be able to work with people who needed help transitioning to a more healthy lifestyle. My specialization was in corrective exercise, in which I focused on correcting postural distortions and faulty movement patterns.</p>

It may not be apparent to the onlooker, but everything I've done to this point has been part of a single overarching theme. I left NYSC to pursue a project with a dietitian, which led to other projects with other dietitians and massage therapists. All of this was while maintaining a private training practice. These projects were part of my desire to reach more people than the few I could work with on a one-to-one basis.  Along the way I helped promote a book launch, designed and built several websites, promoted private practices via diginal marketing, and created online coaching programs.</p>

              <p class="small collapse" id="explore-commentary">I started my web development mini-career by building a few custom wordpress sites for myself, as well as several friends and business partners. I also spent time assisting a pro dev with some of his projects. After realizing I hated &lt? php ?&gt, I learned python and built my own CMS with django.  I really wanted to build something to help with my training clients, so I began building an app to track their progress.  Around this time, Reactjs became all the rage, so I spent quite a bit of time learning it before converting the front end of the app and my blog to be fully Reactified. I also learned the joys of deployment on Heroku and just enough about nginx to get the front and back ends playing nicely together.  The experience gave me all sorts of crazy ideas, which ignited my desire to learn as much as possible about programming.</p>

Part of this was pure curiosity, part was in preparating for a data science bootcamp, and part was an intense desire to do something extraordinarily meaningful with my life.</p>

To me, it was a natural&mdash;yet exciting&mdash;step on my journey. I didn't sleep much during those 12 weeks, as I was determined to fully immerse myself in the data science experience. The <a href="/projects">projects</a> were great, but the people I met during (and after) the program are what I'll take with me everywhere I go.
